**A Real-Time Heart Rate Monitor using Your Smartphone Camera**

## 🔬 Project Description
PulseMate is a browser-based web app that uses your phone’s rear camera to monitor your pulse in real-time — no additional sensors or downloads required.

Built using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **Chart.js**, and the **WebRTC camera API**, PulseMate detects pulse via changes in red light intensity from your finger (photoplethysmography).

## ⚙️ Features

- 📷 Real-time heart rate detection using your smartphone camera
- 📈 Live BPM graph using Chart.js
- 💾 Session memory using browser localStorage
- 🚨 Emergency alert for abnormal heart rate
- 📱 Mobile-first responsive UI

## 💡 How It Works

1. User places their finger over the rear camera.
2. The app captures frames and analyzes the red channel intensity.
3. Peaks in red intensity correspond to heartbeats.
4. BPM is calculated and plotted over time.

## 📲 How to Use

1. Open the app in your **mobile browser**.
2. Click **Start Monitoring**.
3. Place your finger flat on the rear camera lens (preferably with flashlight ON).
4. Your live heart rate and a graph will display within 10–15 seconds.
